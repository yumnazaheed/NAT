"""
Sample client for COMP3331/9331 NAT Assignment

This program sends a series of pre-crafted logical UDP/IPv4 packets to a NAT
implementation running on localhost. It is intended to assist with initial
testing of your NAT system.

Usage:
    python3 sample_client.py <nat_real_internal_port>

Arguments:
    <nat_real_internal_port>  UDP port on localhost where NAT is listening.

Requirements:
    - logical_packets.py must be in the same directory and define an
      iterable `packets`, which contains the pre-crafted packets.

Notes:
    - This client only sends packets; it does not listen for replies.
    - Students are strongly encouraged to develop their own client programs
      and their own logical packets, or extend these, in order to exercise
      all required NAT behaviours and edge cases.

Version: 1.0
